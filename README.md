# Trusworthy 3D Multimodal PET/CT Lesion Segmentation
Adapted from https://github.com/Cocofeat/UMIS

## Motivation
Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging is a vital element of the diagnostic process and clinical management for a wide range of solid tumours
However, precise and consistent lesion segmentation remains challenging, as manual segmentation is time-consuming and subject to intra- and inter-observer variability

**Aim:** to build an automated segmentation model which is not only accurate, but also robust and trustworthy, while avoiding significant increases in computational cost

## Framework Overview
EvidenceCap is a trustworthy medical image segmentation framework based on evidential deep learning, which provides robust segmentation performance and reliable uncertainty quantification for diagnostic support. 
Code provided to train and run inference on evidence cap model for Autopet Challenge PET/CT lesion segmentation and pixel-wise uncertainty quantification.
